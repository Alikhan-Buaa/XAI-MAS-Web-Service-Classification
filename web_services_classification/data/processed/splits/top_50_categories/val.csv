"Trigger.io has developed Forge, a cross-platform app framework that allows web developers to create native iOS and Android apps from a single HTML5 code database. Their SaaS build service employs a Python based open source command line tool that allows developers to execute a build using a single customized JSON config file, and then returns Forge-generated JavaScript and native code templates (their starter plan produces Chrome-ready JavaScript, Java for Android, and Objective-C for iOS). Using the provided Python build tools, app templates, and the build instructions generated by Forge, developers can then complete the final stages of the build locally. The process is completed when the contents of the developer's custom app codeHTML, CSS, and JavaScriptare injected into the Forge-generated code to create finalized native apps. Because the build is created before the integration of user code, developers can easily integrate changes to their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without re-running the build. Trigger's Forge API exposes a variety of methods for working with Forge generated code to create a custom user app experience. A few examples of the functionality provided by this API are detecting platforms, creating notifications, logging end-user preferences, managing tabs and toolbars, adding listeners, and accessing a mobile devices filesystem or camera.",Application Development,trigger io ha developed forge cross platform app framework that allows web developer create native io android apps from single html code database their saas build service employ python based open source command line tool that allows developer execute build using single customized json config file then return forge generated javascript native code template their starter plan produce chrome ready javascript java for android objective for io using provided python build tool app template build instruction generated by forge developer can then complete final stage of build locally process is completed when content of developer custom app codehtml cs javascriptare injected into forge generated code create finalized native apps because build is created before integration of user code developer can easily integrate change their html cs javascript without re running build trigger forge api expose variety of method for working with forge generated code create custom user app experience few example of functionality provided by this api are detecting platform creating notification logging end user preference managing tab toolbars adding listener accessing mobile device filesystem camera,2
